        <h2>How I Created the Watercolor Illustration "Woman with a Candle"</h2>

        <p>
          I have always loved painting with watercolors. I love how the medium
          allows me to create smooth color transitions and create a sense of
          depth. When I decided to create an illustration for my postcardset, I
          immediately thought of a woman holding a candle. I thought it would be
          a very expressive and atmospheric image.
        </p>
        <h2>Sketch</h2>
        <p>
          The first step was to create a sketch. I used a simple pencil to
          create the basic outlines of the woman's figure and the candle. I also
          added a few details to get a sense of how the illustration would look.
        </p>
        <h2>Filling and Details</h2>
        <p>
          Once the sketch was complete, I began filling it in with color. I used
          various shades of blue and white to create a sense of a night sky. I
          also used darker shades to create depth and volume. I started with the
          background, gradually adding layers of color. I did this to create
          smooth transitions and achieve the desired effect. Once the background
          was filled in, I began adding details. I added details to the woman's
          figure, her face, hair, and clothing. I also added details to the
          candle, its wick, and flame. I used darker shades to add contrast and
          depth. I also used lighter shades to add light and highlights.
        </p>
        <h2>Final touches</h2>
        <p>
          The details were added, I completed the illustration by adding final
          touches. I signed the illustration with my name and date.
        </p>
        <h2>Scanning and Photoshop editing</h2>
        <p>
          Then I scanned the illustration on a scanner. This allowed me to
          transfer it to digital format. Importing to digital After scanning, I
          imported the illustration into Photoshop. This allowed me to adjust
          the brightness, contrast, and other image parameters. I also used
          Photoshop to add some additional effects to the illustration. For
          example, I added a bit of noise to make the image more atmospheric.
        </p>
        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>
          I am very happy with the result. I believe that this illustration
          reflects my skills in using watercolors, as well as my ability to
          create expressive and atmospheric images. I hope that this
          illustration will be a great addition to my portfolio.
